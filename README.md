# Financial Market Demand and Supply Analyzer

This project is designed to identify the products or supplies with the most demand for a specific date period, determine the main suppliers of these products, and analyze their stock values. Additionally, it evaluates the percentage change in stock value from the demand period to a specified number of days afterward to assess how much these suppliers profited from the increased demand and subsequent sales.

## Features

- **Demand Identification:** Uses AI/LLM Claude model and prompt engineering to identify the products or categories with the highest demand for a given date range.
- **Supplier Analysis:** Identifies the main suppliers of the high-demand products and retrieves their stock values.
- **Profit Analysis:** Calculates the percentage change in stock value from the demand date to a specified number of days later, indicating the profit margin of the suppliers.

## How It Works

1. **Demand Identification:**
   - Utilizes the Claude AI model and prompt engineering techniques to analyze market data and identify high-demand products or categories for a given date period.
   
2. **Supplier and Stock Value Retrieval:**
   - Determines the main suppliers for the identified high-demand products.
   - Retrieves stock values for these suppliers during the specified date range.

3. **Profit Margin Calculation:**
   - Calculates the percentage change in stock values from the initial demand date to `X` days after.
   - Provides insights into how much the suppliers profited from the increased demand and product sales.
