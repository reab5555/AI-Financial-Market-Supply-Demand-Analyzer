# Financial Market Supply-Demand Profiler
This project is designed to identify the markets or categories of products with the most demand for a specific date, determine the main suppliers of these products in the market, and analyze their growth percentage rate.

## Features
- **Demand Identification:** Uses Claude LLM model by Anthropic and prompt engineering to identify the products or categories with the highest demand for a given date.   
- **Supplier Analysis:** Identifies the main suppliers of the high-demand products and retrieves their stock values.   
- **Profit Analysis:** Calculates the percentage change in stock value from the demand date to a specified number of days later, indicating the profit margin of the suppliers.   

## Prompt Engineering
Claude Opus is an advanced language model developed by Anthropic, designed for a variety of natural language processing tasks guided by prompts.    
   
Prompt engineering involves designing specific prompts that guide the language model to produce the required output. Hereâ€™s how it is applied in this project:      

### Define the Task:   
**User Prompt**   
```
What type of specific products as of {initial_date} were with the most demand?     
```
       
**System Prompt**   
```
As an analyst in finance, list {n_categories} types or categories of products.   
also mention which companies provide these products or services - stocks must be from the {market_index} index.  
```
       
### Specify the Model Output Format:    
```
List the results only in the following format for example:      
|| 1. Products: products | Suppliers: stock symbol 1, stock symbol 2, stock symbol 3, stock symbol 4, stock symbol 5   
|| 2. Products: products | Suppliers: stock symbol 1, stock symbol 2, stock symbol 3, stock symbol 4, stock symbol 5 ||....      
```
    
### Set Parameters:    
   ```bash
   initial_date = "3/2020"   
   n_days = 100   
   market_index = "S&P500"   
   n_categories = 10   
   pct_threshold = 5   
   ```   
- *initial_date*: Date Period: The specific date for identifying high-demand products.   
- *n_days*: The number of days after the demand date to analyze stock value changes.   
- *n_categories*: The number of product markets or categories to display.
- *pct_threshold*: The minimum of percentage increase for market stocks to display for the time period.

## Configuration
### API Key
This project utilizes the Claude AI model through an API. You must manually fill in your API key in the configuration file before running the script. To do this:

    Locate the API_KEY variable.
    Replace the placeholder with your actual Claude AI API key.

Example:   
```bash
client = anthropic.Anthropic
(api_key='your_actual_api_key_here')
```
